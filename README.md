# Mutli Purpose Thermometer - M5 Stack Atom

The program in conjunction with the M5 Stack Atom acts as a multi purpose thermometer.  

The code needs to be uploaded to M5 Atom for it to serve as a thermometer.

There are five modes developed. The codes for first, second, and fifth mode are used to show the current, average, and changed units of temperature
respectively. The third mode represent the temperature in color range while the fourth is for displaying temperature graph

## Installation  

Inorder to upload this code on M5 Atom first download Arduino IDE. Open the code using Arduino IDE. Connect the M5 atom to the computer and upload the code 
from arduino IDE.  You should also install the appropriate libraries to uplad  the code. The most important are the M5 atom, esp32, Fastled, and Adafruit libraries. After this you can try out the M5 atom as thermometer but make sure you supply it with power source. 

## Usage 
To use the M5 atom with the code uploaded on it follow the following instruction. To change between the modes tilt the device to the right and back.
Continue on tilting back and forth to the right for continuous change of mode.
After certain mode with its number appear, press on M5 atom to perform the specic task of the mode written above.
To turn off the device turn the M5 atom face down.
